# using-libclang
This is an experimentation done to use libclang based on the suggestions from:
1. https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/07/03/parsing-c-in-python-with-clang
2. http://devimages.apple.com/llvm/videos/Libclang.mov

The files were experimentally/privately used in viewvc. 
The experiementation involved modifying viewvc with additional information about functions and variables in files.
This allowed in-view browsing.
